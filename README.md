# learning-git-amigoscode

This repo was used to learn git from amigoscode.com

Thankfully to this course I learnt to run in the terminal the most important git commands like create, delete and checkout branches, as well as pull, commit and push. I also understood how to rebase and resolve conficts, before merging with pull request.
